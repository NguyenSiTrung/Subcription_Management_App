- Respect Clean Architecture boundaries when modifying features; update associated tests.
- For database changes, bump Room version, add migration + migration tests before merge.
- Run lint + unit tests (and instrumented tests when feasible) before delivering changes.
- Document significant additions (e.g., update AGENTS.md or CHANGELOG when milestones finished).
- Avoid introducing new Android permissions without user-facing flow updates.
